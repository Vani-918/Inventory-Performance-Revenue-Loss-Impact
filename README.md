__*Business Problem*__
Retail businesses manage thousands of products across stores or warehouses.
However, poor inventory planning often leads to two major issues:
**1.Over-stocking**
Products remain unsold for long periods
Items expire, get damaged, or become obsolete
Storage and holding costs increase
**2.Under-stocking (Stock-outs)**
High-demand products run out of stock
Customers leave without purchasing
Direct revenue loss and customer dissatisfaction
Most retailers do not have a single analytical view to:
Track inventory performance
~ Identify revenue loss due to stock-outs and waste
Understand which products and stores are causing losses
As a result, decisions are often made reactively instead of data-driven, leading to continuous revenue leakage.

__*Objective*__
The objective of the Inventory Performance & Revenue Loss Impact Dashboard is to:
Analyze retail sales and inventory data to measure inventory efficiency, identify revenue loss due to stock-outs and wastage, 
and provide actionable insights to optimize stock levels and improve profitability.
